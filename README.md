## Overview

### Project Outline

The goal for this project was to get used to working with API's. Search the OMDB database with a title key word search, and give the user the option to save a movie to a watch list.

### Current/Continued Development

- What would I like to do to improve the project in the future?
  I would like to make it stateful, and later even enhance the search function. Like being able to search by actor, or movie genre.
- Potential feature list?
  A friend suggested to me a movie catalog that he used to use that isn't around anymore, and I think that with some research and work I could take the core idea here and convert it into something that would fit a movie collectors needs.

## My Process

- General Review of project

  I was already pretty proficient with api's and asynchronous coding before I tackled this project, so the difficult part was decided on how to implement the two pages in one.
  Did I want to build two separate pages, or go the way I ended up going with just manipulating the DOM as a single page? I figured the second option because it would require a smaller code base. But I was concerned with it being a bit more complicated this way.
  I realize with a small project like this the complication isn't going to be that big of a problem, but I wan't to develope that kind of thinking now so it's always on my mind for future larger projects.
  Another big piece that I was focusing on at the time was my skills with CSS. I felt I had a good handle on Javascript, but my styling skills needed work. Using a design file in Figma definitely made building this much easier.

### Built With

- Included technologies:
  OMGB API
  Asynchronous coding
  HTML, CSS, JS
  Flexbox
  Classes

### What I Learned

That when you are faced with two choices that seem to equal when comparing their pros and cons, pick the one that will have less work in general. You can always add more complexity, and put in more hours to get it going.
